# Hang-Man Project

Hang-man project that uses map splice DOM if statements, stores the words in an array. Loops through an if statement and only takes letter values from the keyboard, does not read numbers. As you go along a modal popups once you get the guess the answer or if you lose you get a message. Try it out & have fun. Great project and fun building it.
